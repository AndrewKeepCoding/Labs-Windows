# Windows Community Toolkit Labs - Project Template

This project template comes with a CounterButton control to demonstrate the basic parts expected for Toolkit Labs projects. It includes:

* Library source
* Sample app with two samples
* Unit tests
* UI tests with WinAppDriver
* Documentation

These are all of the areas you will need to remove the CounterButton and add your own code. By the time you finish, do a search for the word "CounterButton" to verify that all the parts are in place.
