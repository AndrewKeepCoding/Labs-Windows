# ProjectTemplate

<!-- Replace the contents of this file with similar descriptions of your component -->

The `CounterButton` showcases a simple control which acts like a button and
increments its displayed value when it is clicked.

## Example
<!-- At least provide a basic example usage or more details here. -->

```csharp

```
<!-- VB.Net samples are optional. If included, 'vb' should also be listed in the 'dev_langs' defined in the header. Code Blocks will be combined if there is no other content between different Code Block languages.
```vb

```
-->

```xaml
    <labs:CounterButton
        Height="48"
        Width="48"
        HorizontalAlignment="Center" 
        VerticalAlignment="Center"
        Background="CadetBlue" />
```
